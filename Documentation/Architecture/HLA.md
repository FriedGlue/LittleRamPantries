# Architecture Overview

This summary provides an overview of the key points regarding the architecture of a microservices-based application for managing food pantry services.

## Architecture Characteristics

- **Microservices-Based**: Each component is a separate microservice, ensuring modularity and scalability.
- **Serverless**: Leverages AWS Lambda for compute, reducing server management overhead.
- **Event-Driven**: Utilizes events for inter-service communication, promoting loose coupling.
- **Decoupled Data Stores**: Each service has its own dedicated database, aligning with microservices best practices.

## Architecture Components

### 1.
**Pantry Management Microservice**
   - Manages pantry inventory and details.
   - **Key Functions**: Inventory tracking, pantry information management, and reporting.
   - **Dependencies**: Relies on data from the Image Optimization and AI Analysis service.
   - **Technologies**: AWS Lambda, RDS/DynamoDB, API Gateway.
   - **Data Management**: Maintains its own database for pantry data.

### 2.
**Usage Management Microservice**
   - Tracks and logs pantry usage.
   - **Key Functions**: Recording usage events, data analysis, report generation.
   - **Technologies**: AWS Lambda, RDS/DynamoDB, API Gateway.
   - **Data Management**: Uses its database for logging usage data.
   - **Interaction**: Communicates with Pantry Management Service for inventory updates.

### 3.
**Image Optimization and AI Analysis Service**
   - Optimizes images and performs AI-based inventory analysis.
   - **Key Functions**: Image processing and recognition using AI.
   - **Technologies**: AWS Lambda (JavaScript for Image Optimization).
   - **Interaction**: Sends analyzed data to Pantry Management Service.

### 4.
**Client Application**
   - Interface for users to interact with pantry data.
   - **Responsibilities**: Displaying inventory, usage statistics, and other relevant information.

## Inter-Service Communication

- **API Gateway**: Manages and routes API requests to appropriate microservices.
- **Event-Based Synchronization**: Services communicate via events for data synchronization, especially for sharing inventory and usage data.
- **Shared Identifiers**: Use of GUIDs to maintain consistency across services for entities like pantries and schools.

## Data Management Strategies

- **NoSQL for Logging**: Logging data will be stored in a NoSQL database, suitable for scalability and flexible schema requirements.
- **SQL for Pantry Management**: Due to the related nature of a pantry belonging to a campus that belongs to a college

## Summary

The architecture represents a well-structured, serverless microservices system. Each service is designed to handle specific functionalities related to pantry management, usage logging, and image processing. The services are loosely coupled, primarily interacting through event-driven mechanisms and APIs, which allows for independent scaling and development. The use of AWS services like Lambda, RDS/DynamoDB, and API Gateway provides a robust and scalable infrastructure.
