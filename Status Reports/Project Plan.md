**Project:**  
MULT 24-620 Acquisition and Visualization of Inventory and Usage Statistics for Little Ram Pantries

**Project Description:**  
Little Ram Pantries are used on the VCU campus to help mitigate food insecurity by providing users with access to free food items. To improve the usage of pantries, additional information regrading their use would be useful. In particular, information about how often they are used, when they are used, what items have been added to the pantries, and what items remain in the pantries should be collected and the data used to create a dashboard that can be viewed by users as well as those supplying the pantries.
