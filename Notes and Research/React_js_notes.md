# React.js Summary  
  
React.js is a JavaScript library for efficient front-end webpage design. When responding to a client request, JS methods on the  called 'components' return DOM elements (or any HTML text) which can then be easily inserted into other components and webpages.  
React pages are written in JSX (modified form of HTML + JS or TypeScript) which are converted into a fully rendered HTML page which can then be served whenever. On the user-end, JS/TS scripting within these pages can fetch info from the back-end.
